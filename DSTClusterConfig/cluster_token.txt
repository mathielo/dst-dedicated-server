This file MUST be generated based on your Steam account. Enter the game and press "Play".
After you're logged in, bring up the console (by pressing `~`) and type the following command:

TheNet:GenerateClusterToken()

Press enter. The console will go away, and a `cluster_token.txt` was generated in:
 - Unix: ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether
 - Windows: C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\Klei\DoNotStarveTogether
 
 Get the generated file and OVERRIDE this one with the proper cluster token.

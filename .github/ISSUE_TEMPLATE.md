Thanks for your feedback! If you're having trouble setting up the server, please describe your issue _as detailed as possible_, making sure to provide these information:

* **What is the host OS?** (Windows, Linux, Mac? Which version?)
* **Where are you running it?** (Local/own computer, VPS, AWS?)
* **Please paste the logs** [as code snippets](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code) for both `Master` and `Caves` shards, found at:

```
~/dst-dedicated-server/DSTClusterConfig/Master/server_log.txt
~/dst-dedicated-server/DSTClusterConfig/Caves/server_log.txt
```

The more information you share the faster we can get your server up and running!
